ABOUT

2ping is a bi-directional ping utility. It uses 3-way pings (akin to TCP 
SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK) and after-the-fact state comparison between a 2ping 
listener and a 2ping client to determine which direction packet loss 
occurs.

INSTALLATION

2ping requires Perl 5.6.0 or newer.  2ping requires several Perl 
modules, all of which are in a standard Perl installation (though your 
distribution may split Perl into "base" and "standard" packages).  
Several non-standard packages are required for optional features, and 
can be installed from you distribution's package management system or 
CPAN.  They are:

  IO::Socket::INET6 (for IPv6 support)
  Digest::SHA (for HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256 auth support)
  Digest::CRC (for HMAC-CRC32 support)

To "build" and install 2ping:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
  make clean

/usr/local is the default Makefile prefix, use PREFIX to override.

USAGE

Please see the man page for full details, but in short, start a listener 
on the far end:

  2ping --listen

And run 2ping on the near end, connecting to the far end listener:

  2ping $LISTENER

Where "$LISTENER" is the name or IP address of the listener.
