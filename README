2PING - A BI-DIRECTIONAL PING UTILITY


http://www.finnie.org/software/2ping/


About

2ping is a bi-directional ping utility. It uses 3-way pings (akin to TCP
SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK) and after-the-fact state comparison between a 2ping
listener and a 2ping client to determine which direction packet loss
occurs.


Installation

Python 2.7 is recommended for 2ping. Python 2.6 is also supported, with
the following notes:

-   The argparse module is also required.
-   Monotonic clock support is not available on Unix platforms, instead
    falling back to time.time() (which will likely be using
    gettimeofday()).

To install:

    sudo python setup.py install


Usage

Please see the 2ping manpage for invocation options, but in short, start
a listener on the far end:

    2ping --listen

And run 2ping on the near end, connecting to the far end listener:

    2ping $LISTENER

Where "$LISTENER" is the name or IP address of the listener.
